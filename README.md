This is the final project in the front end nanodegree curriculum. This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and uses the Google Maps and FourSquare APIs.

The map and list show coffee shops in the vicinity of Folsom, CA. The shop information is taken from FourSquare and their location is displayed as markers on the map. Clicking a marker or the item on the list displays an info box containing the name and address of the restaurant as well as a picture. There is a search bar above the lists of shops, that will filter the list accordingly. Only one marker can be open at a time.
